## Entra code for the Raspberry PI
This code is meant to be installed and ran on the Raspberry PI

If using SSH to run this program remember to detach your terminal screen so that you can have the program continue to run after your SSH connection has closed. I reccomened 'screen' for linux which can make this functionality very easy.

The Rails code that this Raspberry PI server is supposed to communicate with can be found at:

And the live application can be found at:
